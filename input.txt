Line 1: A list of states, Q, separated by tabs.
Line 2: A list of the symbols in Σ, separated by tabs. Th e Empty string
will not be explicitly included. You can assume that the state names do not
also appear in the alphabet.
Line 3: The start state, q0 ∈ Q.
Line 4: The set of v alid accept states, F , separated by tabs.
Line 5: The token BEGIN to denote the start of the transition function
Line 6 to line before last: The transition function. Each line will
be of the form s, x = sf . This is translated to mean that reading
symbol x in state s causes a transition to state sf . The string EPS will
be used to represent an epsilon transition.
Last Line: The token END to denote the end of the transition
function
